# RPi 
RPis, or Raspberry Pis, are the backbone of almost all of the projects here at the DPEA. In practice, they serve as a portable, low cost computer capable of controlling hardware through the DPi Computer+, which we'll interact with in the later sheets. This page describes the setup of the RPi both programmatically and physically.
