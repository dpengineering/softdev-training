How time flies! With the skills you've developed by going through these sheets, you're ready to tackle your first project! You'll be programming the Perpetual Motion machine, which, as the name suggests, moves a ball up and down a ramp till the end of time. Or, well, until you unplug it. 

Note that we only have about 4 Perpetual motion machines (and obviously, more than 4 people in software), so you'll need to split up into groups of two or three to be able to tackle this project. Here, you'll be using your Git skills to be able to collaborate across space (and perhaps even time?) It's a learning curve for sure, so don't be worried if Git seems confusing at first!

- If the perpetual motion machine hardware is not available, let the DPEA software instructor know -- they may be able to get you working on the next project, the Robotic Arm, and then come back and finish up the project later on.
