# TO - DO
To finish out these documents, we need to: 
- describe the process of pushing and pulling from Git in regards to the Perp motion and Arm projects -- this should be quick
- Upload all pertinent assets and animations that have already been created
- Create new assets to better visualize key concepts 
- It'd be nice to include more template Kivy stuff to prevent people from writing boilerplate throughout the sheets the whole time
