To finish out these documents, we need to: 
- Rewrite the stepper and servo pages to integrate the DPi files directly into the website, not some external git repo [HALFWAY DONE]
- describe the process of pushing and pulling from Git in regards to the Perp motion and Arm projects -- this should be quick
- Upload all pertinent assets and animations that have already been created
- Create new assets to better visualize key concepts 
- It'd be nice to include more template Kivy stuff to prevent people from writing boilerplate throughout the sheets the whole time 
- Perhaps add a contribution guide? I'm assuming that there are still quite a few unncessary portions of this website, as I tried my best to include everything on the softdev-training sheets. I'm sure you can trim off more content though to get people to projects faster, but I'm guessing that'll have to be taken up by students, as they'll hopefully know where the issues are and how to solve them 


Hopefully this closes out sometime soon? It's fairly close
